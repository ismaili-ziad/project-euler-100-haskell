# My Haskell solutions to the first 100 problems on Project Euler.
My proposed solutions to the first 100 problems on Project Euler in Haskell (+ explanations).

Project Euler is a website hosting a range of miscellaneous mathematical problems, most of them requiring an algorithmic approach to be solved.

I would like to share my own strategy in Haskell to a certain range of problem. In order to be in line with Project Euler's policy (as stated here: https://projecteuler.net/about), no solution to a problem above the 100th mark will be publicly published.

I intend to complete and update this repository as things progress.
